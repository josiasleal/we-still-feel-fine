We Still Feel Fine
==================

## Contributing

I â™¥ pull requests. Here's how to contribute:

1. Fork and pull repo.
2. If you don't have node, [install it](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs).
3. From the repo directory, `npm install --save-dev`
4. `grunt watch`: This will automatically JSHint all JavaScript, concatenate and minify the client-side JavaScript, and compile the LESS every time you save. Watch for JSHint errors and correct them.
5. Rename `keys-sample.js` as `keys.js` and update it with your twitter credentials. This file is .gitignored, so it won't be checked in if you push this to a public repo.
6. Code!
